# ANONHACK.EXE

This game is my first game jam game, so naturally it is a platformer.
It was submitted to Ludum Dare 25 in December 2012.

The platformer gimmick is that the character can teleport small distances to a moving target.

The goal of the game is to navigate through a series of levels to reach the CPU, which is then "hacked".

## Controls

* Move: **A/D**
* Jump: **W**
* Teleport: **Space**. Hold to spawn target, release to teleport.

If you release **Space** before the wind-up finishes it will not register, so you have to press it again to complete the teleport.
