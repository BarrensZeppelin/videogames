# Your Efforts are In Vain

My second game jam game. Made for Ludum Dare 26 in April 2013.

Making nice levels for platformers is hard, so this time I chose to have the "content" fully randomly generated.

I also gave up on "graphics" and used square boxes for the player and enemies.
Though, I did add some nice visual effects to make up for it, such as screen shakes on near-impact and stop-the-world/slow-motion on impact.

The goal of the game is to evade incoming enemies for as long as possible with somewhat limited controls of the character.

## Controls

* Move: **A/D**
