# Owl'd Hurricrash

This game was submitted to Ludum Dare 31 in December 2014, two years after the release of ANONHACK.EXE.

The goal of the game is to collect fish and gold coins to get a high score.
It ends when your food meter reaches 0. To refill the food meter catch some fish in the sea.
The owl can dive (?), but only for a limited amount of time.
To cash in points collected from fish and coins return the owl to its nest.

The game also ends if the owl crashes into the cliff too hard, which can easily happen if it is caught in a gust of wind, or if it runs out of oxygen.

The game has both graphics *and* visual effects!
I learned how to apply shaders in SFML, so there is both a reflection of the sky in the water and a general bloom filter.

## Controls

The owl has [tank controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_controls) to make the game hard.

* Turn: **A/D**
* Fly "forwards": **Space**
